# Ergo Score Calculator

Simple Javascript calculator to compare times and or distances rowed on a
Concept 2 ergometer with other club members, taking age, weight and sex into
account for a more fair ranking.

This calculator was made to easily calculate the score for participants to the
internal Ergometer Challenge of my rowing club, [KAR&ZV De Hoop][1], but feel
free to use it for your own Ergometer Challenges too!

## Version 1 (2016)
The first edition the Challenge consisted of rowing 5k on a Concept 2 ergometer
and getting the best possible split. We used the following format to determine
the final score compensated for gender, weight and age.

* Row fasted possible 5k and take your average split
* Transform the average split to an output of watts / kg
* Compensate for decreased performance per year over the age of 30 by 0,8%
* Use a 15% multiplier for female participants

## Version 2 (2017)
In the section edition of the competition we changed some rules as both older
and female members felt the compensation score was not totally fair. This time
we used a modified format to make the end result more fair.

* Row as many meters as possible in 20 minutes
* Compensate that distance for your weight
* Compensate for decreased performance per year over the age of 30 by 0,65%
* Use a 20% multiplier for female participants
